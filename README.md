# Pray Project

An open-source mobile application to help people engage in prayer worldwide. This projects contains the server API and the web client.

# Why this ?

Well, we (too) often engage with mobile applications. Many times for seemingly unimportant things. Why not taking the habit of using technology to draw us closer to God. Some projects have already brought so much like the YouVersion Bible App. Now is the time to bring the best possible experience for anyone who wants to pray, keep track of their topics, take notes on them and more importantly share them with friends.

# Are we production ready ?

The project is in the early stage. Cleary now is the time for early adopters to engage and provide feedbacks. We already received amazing reports and we are more motivated than ever to bring this project to mass market.
