In order to provide a great user experience and quickly learn from user feedback, during the beta phase we tend to keep more data on our servers that we'll do in the long end. Also not all data are yet end-to-end encrypted. By participating to the Beta program you agree to share more informations than usual. We trust that you'll enjoy this app and we thank you so much for being a part of this journey with us.</p>
